However, many of the widely-used libraries are written in lower level languages, compiled for the specific platform and accessible from Python. These often are optimized/parallelized (e.g. numpy, scikit-image). With numpy, for example, you have to employ specific strategies to write fast running Python code (avoid loops, vectorization - but same is true for Matlab). Furthemore, Python offers some nice ways to parallelize python code as well (e.g. Cython, where you can write parallel for-loops with ease - not that this code then has to be compiled). There are also several libraries that utilize the GPU (e.g. pytorch).

Amended by @jni: Virtually all experienced Python users I know use tidy, specific environments for only specific tasks, but generally work in a “catch-all” environment where everything gets installed and updated to the latest versions, since this works well most times. However, it’s possible to break an environment with sufficient hammering with new and experimental packages, particularly when mixing conda and pip installs, and when it does break, it’s good if that isn’t the base/root environment, because then it is very cheap to burn it down and start again. So I would indeed recommend users to have a clean base miniconda install, where only conda and pip ever get updated, and then use another environment as their “quasi-root”.
